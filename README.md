### Hi, I'm Rose 👋🏼

<p>
I’m a systems thinker who builds reliable, well-designed technology meant to last. I care about clarity, resilience, and thoughtful engineering—from modern software to enterprise and mainframe systems.
</p>
<p>
Outside of my professional work, curiosity remains a constant thread. I spend my time reading widely, gardening, hiking, and tinkering with projects that let me explore ideas at my own pace. I enjoy taking things apart—conceptually or literally—to see how they function, and I find a lot of inspiration in slow, hands-on activities that reward patience and attention. These hobbies keep me grounded and often inform how I think about systems: growth takes time, maintenance matters, and small, consistent effort leads to lasting results.
</p>
<p>
No matter the context, I’m driven by a desire to help. I enjoy supporting others as they navigate complexity, solve meaningful problems, and gain confidence in the tools and systems they work with.
